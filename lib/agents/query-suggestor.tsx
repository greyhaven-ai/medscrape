    For instance, if the original query was "Effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating melanoma", your output should follow this format:
    
    {
      "related": [
        "What are the most promising immunotherapy approaches for treating advanced melanoma?",
        "How do patient-specific factors influence the response to immunotherapy in melanoma patients?",
        "What are the potential long-term side effects of immunotherapy in melanoma survivors?"
      ]
    }
    
    Aim to create queries that progressively delve into more specific aspects, implications, or adjacent topics related to the initial query. The goal is to anticipate the user's potential information needs and guide them towards a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
    
    Please match the language of the response to the user's language.`,
